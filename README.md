# Reflection Questions

- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensured the security and functionality of my code through the use of JUnit tests. These tests cover over 80% of the code and follow a specification-based design: each
software requirement being tested individually. This ensures that the program does exactly what it was intended to do, securely, through meticulous testing. My goal
was to make sure my code always behaved as expected and to identify potential weaknesses beforehand.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs from software requirements, and I use them as a sort of checklist: implementing requirements one at a time. Along the way, I think about
end-user experience and try to think of other, supplemental needs that would need to be met in order for the software to have its required functionality. In other
words, if a software requirement has pre-requisites that may or may not have been identified in the original design.

- How do I approach designing software?

My usual approach to software design is to focus on the base requirements as strictly as possible. I said in a previous response how I use software requirements
like a checklist when developing a program. When designing, I try to simplify each requirement as much as possible, then I combine similar ones. By default, 
I try and use object-oriented programming (OOP) whenever possible to at least organize my designs. My philosophy is that treating software as a bundle of
individual features makes it easier to design, develop, and understand.
